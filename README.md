# SD4SE-project
This is the repo of our course project for "Software Development for Start-up Entrepreneurs"

## Team Members:

  - BALCH, ANDREW
  - MÉNARD, STEVEN BENOÎT
  - SCHULTZ, ZACH
  - KHAW, JEREMY

## Assignment-3 update:

assignment-3 contains the actual application. As of now, it is pretty spaghetti-coded and needs to be better organized. If we plan on continuing this project some potential technologies for our use would be Backbone.js and Node.js
